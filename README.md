# Face-Emotion-Recognition-using-GoogleNet-ONNX
This project uses the GoogleNet Deep Learning Architecture in an ONNX model trained on a custom dataset for Facial Emotion Recognition. It detects faces with Haar-Cascade Algorithm using OpenCV and classifies emotions efficiently using ONNX Runtime, enabling applications in HCI, mental health, and security.
